# Lecture 06: Conditional Programming

## Motivation

Deciding what to do on a case by case is widely used in decision making and also in programming. Conditional programming enables writing codes with this in mind. If a certain condition holds execute a command otherwise do something different. Conditional programming is an element of the basic programming technique, which emerges in multiple situations. Adding this technique to the programming toolbox is a must for data scientists.
