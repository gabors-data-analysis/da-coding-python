# Lecture 00: Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebook

## Motivation

In this course, we focus on Python and Jupyter Notebook. This means you won’t learn anything about R, Julia, or any other programming language useful for data science. They’re also excellent choices, and in practice, most data science teams use a mix of languages, often at least Python and R.

## This lecture

This is the starting lecture, that introduces students to Python and Jupyter notebook (download and install), installs the virtual environment, runs a pre-written script, and highlights the importance of version control.

The aim of this class is not to teach coding, but to make sure that everybody has Python, Jupyter Notebook and the virtual environment installed on their laptop. The main aim of these steps is to reveal possible OS mismatches or other problems with R and RStudio. 
The material and steps are detailed in [`getting_started.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture00-intro/getting_started.ipynb) and [`setup.md`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture00-intro/setup.md).


## Learning outcomes
After successfully teaching the material, students will have

- Python and Jupyter Notebook on their laptop/computers

and understand,

- How Jupyter Notebook looks like, which window is which.
- How to run a command via console using VSCode.
- What are packages, and how to install and load them into the virtual environment.
- Why version control is important and what are the main possibilities with Git and GitHub.

These steps are found to be extremely important, as fixing installation problems may take days to weeks.

## Datasets used
* No dataset is used in this lecture

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **20-30 mins**.

It can substantially differ from this if the teacher decides to do a live coding session with students and fixes the emerging problems during the class (up to ~90 mins).

## Homework

No homework, apart from fixing possible issues.
