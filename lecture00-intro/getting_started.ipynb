Instead, a Jupyter notebook is stored as a file in the [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. The advantage is that we can mix formatted text, Python code and code output. It requires the Jupyter notebook server to run it though, and therefore isn't a stand-alone Python program as described above. Other than that, there is no difference between the Python code that goes into a program file or a Jupyter notebook.\n",

    "## Version control: Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is an essential part of coding. It ensures that you keep proper track of your progress when writing a code for analysis or developing a code/package/material etc. We strongly encourage you to create this good habit during this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to do version control all of it has some benefits and drawbacks. Here we list the three most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (and [friends](https://www.slant.co/options/13488/alternatives/~github-desktop-alternatives), eg. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)):\n",
    "  - Application to conveniently keep track of your modifications, commit, pull and push to GitHub\n",
    "  - Pro: easy to use, flexible for all types of files, helps to avoid conflicts\n",
    "  - Con: extra application, should create a habit and not forget about it :)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shell/Terminal\n",
    "  - Using shell or terminal for version control\n",
    "  - Pro: flexible for all types of files, can do literally everything there\n",
    "  - Con: hard to learn, can make mistakes, which is hard to correct\n",
    "  \n",
    "It does not matter what you use, the main issue is to use version control. It makes your life much easier, especially with complicated projects, where you have to test and try out different directions. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great platform to collaborate, however, there are others as well.\n",
    "\n",

    "## VS Code: An IDE For Python Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "While the course is using Jupyter nootebooks, Python codes in production environments are run from script files ending with a `.py` extension. Jupyter offers a simple text editor to write script files but most developers use some special software application, a so-called 'integrated development environment', or IDE, to write these scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the many possible alternative IDEs we recommend Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, a free Microsoft tool for these developments. It is a light-weight code editor with miriad of possible extensions which enable VS Code to support basicly *any* kind of programming languages. Beyond particular language supports VS Code also has solutions for things like version control, container management or cloud access. VS Code works equally well on Windows, MAC or Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and tutorials can be accessed through the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using the [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension for Python projects but other options can equally be fine. The course does not cover the deployment of production-ready Python solutions, so VS Code is just an optional component of your toolkit for using Python later. \n",

    "## Appendix: A Primer On Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is an isolated workspace for a particular project. In effect it is a directory structure which contains Python executable files and other files which tell Python the packages and their version numbers to use in that project. We set up this environment to make sure that all readers get exactly the same results when running the code snippets on the book's exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want ot take a deep dive into Python's virtual environment read [this](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) detailed discussion of the topic. Beyond the dosumentation we refer above you can also get some more technical information about `pipenv` [here](https://pipenv-searchable.readthedocs.io/). \n",
