# Lecture 13: Advanced Linear Regression

## Motivation

You have analyzed your data on hotel prices in a particular city to find hotels that are underpriced relative to how close they are to the city center. But you have also uncovered differences in terms of other features of the hotels that measure quality and are related to price. How would you use this data to find hotels that are underpriced relative to all of their features? And how can you visualize the distribution of hotel prices relative to what price you would expect for their features in a way that helps identify underpriced hotels?

After understanding simple linear regression, we can turn to multiple linear regression, which has more than one explanatory variable. Multiple linear regression is the most used method to uncover patterns of associations between variables. There are multiple reasons to include more explanatory variables in a regression. We may be interested in uncovering patterns of association between y and other explanatory variables, which may help us understand differences in terms of the x variable we are interested in most. Or, we may be interested in the effect of an x variable, but we want to compare observations that are different in x but similar in other variables. Finally, we may want to predict y, and we want to use more x variables to arrive at better predictions.

We discuss why and when we should estimate multiple regression, how to interpret its coefficients, and how to construct and interpret confidence intervals and test the coefficients. We discuss the relationship between multiple regression and simple regression. We explain that piecewise linear splines and polynomial regressions are technically multiple linear regressions without the same interpretation of the coefficients. We include an informal discussion on how to decide what explanatory variables to include and in what functional form.

Finally, we want to generalize the results of a regression from the data we are analyzing to a decision situation we care about. We can use methods to quantify the uncertainty brought about by generalizing to the general pattern represented by the data (statistical inference), and we can have guidelines to assess whether the general pattern represented by the data is likely close to the general pattern behind the situation we care about (external validity).

## This lecture

This lecture introduces multiple variable regressions via [hotels-europe](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#hotels-europe) dataset. It introduces topics on

  - how to choose a model from many possible candidates based on R2, 
  - how to evaluate prediction with multiple regressors: 
      - different graphs prediction uncertainty, and 
      - calculate the confidence and prediction intervals. 
      
Moreover, it covers external validity with robustness test: checking model results in different time/location/type of observations. Finally, as an extra part, it shows a simple example of using a training and test sample to better understand the process of model choice and the limitation of R2.

This lecture is based on

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing [`hotels_advanced_regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture13-advanced-linear-regression/hotels_advanced_regression.ipynb), students should be able to:

  - Visualize multiple explanatory variables with the outcome:
    - With a scatter plot decide the functional form which is needed.
  - Multiple linear regression
    - Use `statsmodels` to estimate regressions with multiple explanatory variables
    - Use `stargazer` to compare multiple candidate models and report model statistics such as R2 to evaluate models.
  - Analysing model prediction
    - Get model predictions and residuals and in case of a log-transformed outcome, how to convert the predictions and residuals into level.
    - y-yhat scatter plot with 45-degree line to evaluate prediction uncertainty
    - residual-yhat or residual-explanatory variable scatter plot to evaluate model performance along different dimensions
  - Confidence and Prediction interval
    - Using `get_prediction` function to get confidence and prediction interval
    - Set the significance level for the intervals with `alpha` input argument
    - Convert log-transformed outcome confidence and/or prediction intervals into level. Limitations.
  - External Validity: robustness checks
    - Estimate a selected model with different data to assess model uncertainty
    - Using different time periods, locations, and types of hotels/apartments.
    - Compare these models to the original and evaluate external validity
  - Extra:
    - Split the original sample into a training and test samples
    - Use the training sample to estimate the model and the test sample to predict hotel prices
    - Evaluate which model performs better with RMSE measure.

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **100 mins**.

Going through [`hotels_advanced_regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture13-advanced-linear-regression/hotels_advanced_regression.ipynb takes around *70-80 minutes*. There are many discussions and interpretations of the models, which are similarly important.  Solving the tasks takes the remaining *20-30 minutes*. 


## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 20 mins

Choose a different city from Vienna and make sure you have **at least 100 observations after filtering**. Create at least 3 models with at least 3 explanatory variables (check for transformation) and choose the best. Imagine you can build a new hotel in your city and can specify the feature values as you wish. Predict the price and estimate confidence and prediction intervals with a 90% significance level. Set the price of your hotel and argue, why is it your choice.
