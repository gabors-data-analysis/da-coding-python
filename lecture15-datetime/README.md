# Lecture 15: Date and time manipulations

## Motivation

Time series data is often used to analyze business, economic, and policy questions. Time series data presents additional opportunities as well as additional challenges for regression analysis. Unlike cross-sectional data, it enables examining how y changes when x changes, and it also allows us to examine what happens to y right away or with a delay. However, variables in time series data come with some special features that affect how we should estimate regressions, and how we can interpret their coefficients.

One of these differences is the frequency of the time series. It can vary from seconds to years. Time series with more frequent observations have higher frequency, e.g. monthly frequency is higher than yearly frequency, but it is lower than daily frequency. The frequency may also be irregular with gaps in-between. Gaps in time series data can be viewed as missing values of variables. But they tend to have specific causes. To run a regression of y on x in time series data, the two variables need to be at the same time series frequency. When the time series frequencies of y and x are different, we need to adjust one of them. Most often that means aggregating the variable at a higher frequency (e.g., from weekly to monthly). With flow variables, such as sales, aggregation means adding up; with stock variables and other kinds of variables, such as prices, it is often taking an average for the period or taking the last value, such as the closing price.

Another fundamental feature of time series data is that variables evolve with time. They may hover around a stable average value, or they may drift upwards or downwards. A variable in time series data follows a trend if it tends to change in one direction; in other words, it has a tendency to increase or decrease. Another possible issue is seasonality. Seasonality means that the value of the variable is expected to follow a cyclical pattern, tracking the seasons of the year, days of the week, or hours of the day. Because of such systematic changes, later observations tend to be different from earlier observations. Understanding trends and seasonality is important because they make regression analysis challenging. They are examples of a broader concept, non-stationarity. Stationarity means stability; non-stationarity means the lack of stability. Stationary time series variables have the same expected
value and the same distribution at all times. Trends and seasonality violate stationarity because the expected value is different at different times.

## This lecture

This lecture introduces basic date and time-variable manipulations. The first part starts with the basics using `datetime` package by overviewing basic time-related functions and manipulations with time-related values and variables. The second part discusses time-series data aggregation from different frequencies along with visualization for time-series data and unit root tests.

This lecture utilizes the case study of [Chapter 12, A: Returns on a company stock and market returns](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/casestudies/#ch12a-returns-on-a-company-stock-and-market-returns) as homework, and uses [`stocks-sp500`](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#stocks-sp500) dataset.

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing [`datetime_part_I_basics.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture15-datetime/datetime_part_I_basics.ipynb) and [`datetime_part_II_manipulations.ipynb`](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture15-datetime/datetime_part_II_manipulations.ipynb), students should be:

  - Familiar with the `datetime` package, especially with
    - creating specific time variables, converting other types of variables into a date or datetime object
    - understand the importance of time zones
    - Get specific parts of a date object such as `year, quarter, month, day, hour etc.`
    - Understand the difference between duration and periods
  - Carry out time aggregation
    - Aggregate different time series objects to lower frequencies, using mean/median/max/end date, etc.
    - Adding `lag`-ged and differenced variables to data
  - Visualize time series with
    - handle time variable on x-axis with `scale_x_date()`  
    - `facet_wrap` to stack multiple graphs
    - standardize variables and put multiple lines into one graph  
  - Unit root tests using `arch` package's `PhillipsPerron` function
    - understanding the result of the Philip-Perron test and deciding if the variable needs to be differenced or not. 

## Datasets used

- [`stocks-sp500`](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#stocks-sp500)

## Lecture Time

Ideal overall time: **35-40 mins**.

Going through the notebooks takes around *30 minutes*. There are some discussions and interpretations of the time series (e.g. stationarity). Solving the tasks takes the remaining *5-10 minutes*. The lecture can be shortened by only showing the methods. It will be partially repeated in [lecture16-timeseries-regression](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da-coding-python/blob/main/lecture16-timeseries-regression).


## Homework

*Type*: quick practice, approx 10 mins

Estimate the *beta* coefficient between quarterly SP500 log returns on Microsoft stocks log return. Use the [`stocks-sp500`](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#stocks-sp500) dataset. Take care when aggregating the data to a) use the last day in the quarter and then take the logs and then difference the variable to get log returns. When estimating the regression use heteroskedastic robust standard error (next lecture we learn how to use Newey-West SE).
